What is the design pattern?
Design patterns are nothing but documented and tested solutions to the recurring problem.
Design patterns are used to solve the problem of object generation and integration.
Do not overdo design pattern, remember that design patterns are for projects and projects are not for design pattern.

Types of design pattern
Creational: Object creation and initialization
Creational design pattern helps us to centralise the object creation logic and depending upon the condition it will create and initialise the appropriate object and returns that object

Structural: Structural changes of a class and interface, relation between classes
Structural design pattern helps us in maintaining the structure change of a project. For example: Customer is dependent on a Product. There is a change in the Product class, so now the structural design pattern helps in keeping the separation of Customer and Product class. 

Behavioural: Communications between objects
